* few bad attempts at this, trying to memoize sums (in case groups were repeated, which they probably wouldn't be a lot?), and only adding when necessary (kept this in), before realizing that only needed to check all groups of the same size, otherwise i could stop as soon as a found that at least one solution was found for a given smallest group...actually i could probably change that filter call to a find for more efficiency
